## Day 6 - Type Ahead

When you type a word, it will show you every single city/state that matches the word along with the corresponding population. 

First, we need to fetch the data (provided).
Whenever someone types in something, it's going to filter from the data (array).

1. Need to have an empty array to store the data
2. Fetch the data - fetch will return a promise
3. Use the promise to filter the data that matches the word entered
