## Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2

A few new array methods.
Two arrays with people and comments - will be using methods such as:
- .sum: checks if at least one thing in the array meets what we're looking for
- .every: checks if every single one in the array meets what you're looking for 
- .find: return the first item that it finds
- .findIndex: outputs the index of whatever you're looking for in the array


###### side note:
- Wrap curly brackets around console.log arguments to see the variable name when logged. This takes advantage of ES6 shorthand syntax
> const isCool = true; const age = 100;
> console.log(isCool, age);
true 100
> console.log({isCool, age});
Object {
    age: 100
    isCool: true
}
